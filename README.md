### Hi there ðŸ‘‹Iâ€™m @Huimeng Wang. 

Now I am an undergraduate student majoring in Automation science and engineering at :school:[Xi'an Jiao Tong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). At the same time, I am an incoming Ph.D. student of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html) in 2023 Fall. 

- ðŸ‘€ You can find different contact ways easily, such as [Gmail](wanghuimeng66@gmail.com) and [twitter account](https://twitter.com/WANGHUIMENG_) in my github homepage, but please contact me by email in high frequency of use compared with other ways if you have some emergency. I plan to maintain a personal website in academic style in next several weeks, so I will update the link once I finish it. 


## Hobby
:blush: Hobbies is an important part of my life.

- :runner: Long-distance race is challenging but attached to a remarkable sense of accomplishment. Just try your best to run and hold the belief that NO HUMAN IS LIMITED!!!

- :tennis: Tennis is one of the most exciting and enjoyable sports. Every shot on the tennis court will be curved into my memory.
